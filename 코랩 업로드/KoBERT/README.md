<h1>Korean Text classification with KoBERT</h1>

## **Aim of the project**
In this project, we aim to build binary classification models capable to determine whether the inputted Korean conversation text is voice phishing ("1") or non-voice phishing ("0") related text.

The API used are Tensorflow for BERT model and Pytorch fror KoBERT model.


## **Desired outputs of the project**
From the trained models, we expect to achieve great classification performance on this voice phishing dataset such as the model tells us if a conversation is harmful or not harmful.
At the end of this project, we will look at the accuracy of the model on the test set.
